### Image
**Path:** `./test_image_biology.jpg`

### Query
**Question:** Which of these organisms contains matter that was once part of the lichen?

### Context
Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada...

### Choices
- bilberry
- mushroom

### Model Response
```
**Step-by-step reasoning:**
Use the arrows to follow the path of energy through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the lichen.
The only arrow pointing to the bilberry starts from the bear sedge. The bear sedge does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not flow from the lichen to the bilberry.
The only arrow pointing to the mushroom starts from the bear sedge. The bear sedge does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not flow from the lichen to the mushroom.
